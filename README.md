# Halix Action SDK

The **Halix Action SDK** (`@halix/action-sdk`) provides a development framework for creating NodeJS Lambda-based actions that run inside the [Halix Platform](https://halix.io). It offers a streamlined API for handling incoming events, interacting with Halix data services, and sending structured responses back to the platform.

> üìå **Note:** This SDK is **source-available** and is **licensed for use only within applications running on the Halix platform.**  
> See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for full terms.

## üì¶ Installation

No installation is required.

The `@halix/action-sdk` is **natively available in the Halix platform runtime** and does not need to be manually installed or included via NPM.

Import the SDK using ECMAScript module syntax:

```js
import * as hx from '@halix/action-sdk';
```

This makes all SDK utilities available under the `hx.` namespace for clean and consistent access throughout your action logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Here‚Äôs a minimal example of a Halix action written in Node.js with ES module syntax:

```js
import * as hx from '@halix/action-sdk';

export const handler = async (event) => {
  // Initialize the SDK with incoming event context
  hx.initialize(event);

  // Get the subject of the action
  const obj = hx.actionSubject;

  // Refresh the object from the server
  let fullObj;
  try {
    fullObj = await hx.getObject("exampleType", obj.objKey);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error fetching object", err);
    return hx.prepareErrorResponse("Failed to retrieve data");
  }

  // Perform updates or logic
  fullObj.status = "Updated";

  // Save the updated object
  let saved;
  try {
    saved = await hx.saveRelatedObject("parentType", fullObj.parentKey, "exampleType", fullObj);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error saving object", err);
    return hx.prepareErrorResponse("Failed to save data");
  }

  // Return a success response
  return hx.prepareSuccessResponse({
    responseType: "formTemplateAction",
    updatedSubject: saved,
    successMessage: "Object saved successfully",
    isError: false
  });
};
```

This action pattern is typical for use in Halix‚Äôs Lambda-style runtime environment.

## üìò Key Concepts

- `authToken`: Auth token for secure API calls
- `sandboxKey`: Identifies the current Halix solution environment
- `actionSubject`: Object being acted on (varies by context)
- `userContext`: Info about the executing user
- `params`: Inputs passed to the action
